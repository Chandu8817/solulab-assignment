## Overview

The project consists of two agents that communicate via message queues. The agents are capable of generating messages, processing incoming messages, checking token balances on Ethereum, and transferring tokens based on specified conditions.

### Agent Features

- **Agent 1**: Processes messages every 10 seconds, checks token balance, and transfers tokens if the message contains "crypto."
- **Agent 2**: Generates random two-word messages every 2 seconds and places them into Agent 1's inbox. It generates messages from a predefined list of words.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then, open the `.env` file and fill in the values accordingly:

    ```plaintext
    ETH_NODE_URL=https://rpc.tenderly.co/YOUR_TENDERLY_PROJECT_URL   # Tenderly node URL
    FROM_ADDRESS=0xYourFromAddressHere                               # Address initiating the transactions
    SOURCE_ADDRESS=0xYourSourceAddressHere                           # Address holding token funds (e.g., USDC)
    TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourTokenContractAddressHere            # USDC or other ERC20 token contract address
    PRIVATE_KEY=YourPrivateKeyHere                                   # Private key of FROM_ADDRESS (keep secure)
    ```

5. Fill in the `.env` file with your Ethereum node URL, source address, and token contract address.

## Usage

Fund the virtual tenderly ETH to perform the transaction

```bash
curl "https://virtual.mainnet.rpc.tenderly.co/1ddbd660-a5ba-4589-b77f-982707da7391" \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tenderly_setBalance",
    "params": [["FROM_ADDRESS"], "0x3635C9ADC5DEA00000"]
}'
```


To run the agents, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The agents will start processing and generating messages based on their defined behaviors.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest test.py
```

The tests will validate the functionality of the agents and their interactions.
